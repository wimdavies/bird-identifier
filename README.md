# bird-identifier

Update 13/10/23:
This project was originally intended as a clone of the RSPB's 'Identify a Bird' service, once located [here](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/identify-a-bird/). However, mid-development, that tool was taken offline. Its [successor](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/a-z) currently lacks an equivalent filtering system, and isn't backed by the same observer-intuitive data as the original. Moreover, the species API powering the new site is buggy. You can read my whole sorry story of discovery in the [progress notes](https://github.com/wimdavies/bird-identifier/blob/main/notes/notes.md) I made.

This project is now on hiatus, pending significant progress by the RSPB towards a replacement for the original bird identification tool.
